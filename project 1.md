## Story
In the great jungle, there was a goat so cool, she couldn't bear to helplessly eat grass with her fellow goats while tigers roamed by, eating her fellow goat friends. So she picked up a skateboard and began tearing through the jungle, eating grass as fast as possible while the mean, lame-o tigers try and put hown her radical ride!

## Aesthetics
Cartoonish and groovy. Sound would be totally tubular.

## Gameplay
### Overview
2D endless runner with jumping, grass eating, and tiger avoiding.
### Feel
Fast and furry-ious! (Goats have fur.)
### Mechanics
+ Endlessly moving forward
+ Can jump up while on ground
+ Platforms pass above and can be jumped on
+ As player passes through it, player eats grass which grows on the ground and on platforms
+ TIGERS! They run on the ground and occasionally jump onto platforms. Colliding with a tiger results in getting eaten by said tiger
