# The Floor is Lava and Wants to Marry You

## High Concept/Genre 
"3D shooter where you are continually climbing up a seemingly endless lava tube as lava rises up from the bottom of the level to incinerate you!"

## Platform
The game will be available on desktop via Steam.

## Story
In a harebrained scheme to literally inherit the earth, you seduced a goddess of a volcano and arranged a wedding in order to get ownership of the earth itself. Your plan backfired when on the day of the wedding, you realized that you would have to kiss your magma-hot bride in order to seal the marriage. Rather than melting your face off, you decide to skip the wedding and run away. Your bride becomes furious and starts chasing after you in the form of a lava flow and sends her fiery servants to stop you from escaping. However, like any good American, you brought your pump action shotgun with unlimited ammo with you to the wedding and are ready to fight your way out.

## Aesthetics
Graphics: Abstract/cartoonish, like Lovely Planet or High Hell. Color palette would probably incoporate a dark colors and shades of red and brown.
Sound: Hard and crunchy, like Quake 1 sfx.
UI: Very minimal, you don't need much for a FPS with one weapon. 

## Gameplay 
Quake style fast paced movement and shooting along with frequent but easy platforming. In the volcano tunnel, there are many platforms that you must jump between to go higher and higher. Along the way up, you must shoot down dastardly fire imps that threaten to poke you with their sharp claws. The floor, which is lava, which is your bride, is constantly rising, forcing you to keep going up and up or else face jealous incineration.
